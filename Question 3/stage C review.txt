As noted under the final print. Any usage of punctuation will ruin the system.
In an ideal system this would all be stripped from the input however currently I am not due to time constraints.
Another thing to note is that any words under 5 characters long are to be treated as highly
unaccurate and will most likely throw a false positive as a maori word due to a lack of structure
outside of simple letters within the maori alphabet

This algorithm can be expected to work fairly accurately in situations where it is feed the right input.
This input should contain no punctuation and words are ideally longer than 5 characters long.
Input can be either case.
