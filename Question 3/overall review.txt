A best case approach would be to combine both algorithm's work off of a combined confidence factor
but, I think, provided that both programs are given the ability to strip punctuation
from any input before handling it, then both programs accuracy would sky rocket.

I personally think that the program to check against common words is the most
successful because it doesn't rely on a per character basis, which can be easily
beaten by smaller english words that fit into the maori alphabet.

Going forward with NLP, I would first start with a common word check, after which
I would check the given confidence factors and if it is not satisfactory I would
then proceed to check characters against the maori alphabet as seen in the first
program before combining the two outputs for a final, accurate decision.


If I have time towards the end of this exam I will endeavor to revisit these
programs and address the inherent punctuation issues, however, since this is
the first question I am attempting I do not feel comfortable staying on this longer
than the time I already have.
